TODO
- (?) Revisit serializer. Instead of having the constant pool do so much work, make helpers or a wrapper. i.e. addMultiname should not add strings and all the other stuff it does
- Revisit de-duplicating constant pool. Make proper equals() methods and use hashing algorithms or similar to make it faster
- Do you even need to parse method bodies? The MethodInfos and ClassInfos should give you everything you need to make a proxy...

DONE
- Revisit deserializer. It doesn't need a smart constant pool - just needs to store the values
- Make the deserializer smart enough to verify pool/collection sizes as it goes
